As the authors of this technique explained, the time series bitmap is ["...a simple
parameter-light tool that allows users to efficiently navigate through large collections of time series..."](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_bitmaps.pdf). Based on SAX transform and occurrence frequency counting, the time series bitmap algorithm transforms any input time series (or its segment) into bitmap.
